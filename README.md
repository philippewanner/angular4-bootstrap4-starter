# Angular 4 Bootstrap 4 Starter Kit

This project is useful to whoever want to work with Angular 4 and Bootstrap 4.

## To reproduce this starter kit
Run `ng new angular4-bootstrap4-starter --style=scss` for creating a new Angular project with the CLI.

Go in the newly created folder `cd angular4-bootstrap4-starter` and install bootstrap (the last version) with `npm i bootstrap@next --save`

Start your IDE and open the project, then in the file `sytles.scss` add `@import "../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";`

Last step, build and start your project with `ng serve`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
